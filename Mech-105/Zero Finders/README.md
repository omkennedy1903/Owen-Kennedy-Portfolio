##bZero.m
Finds the zero of a function using the bisection method.

###Inputs
f - the function to be examined, in the form on an anonymous function. 
x0 - the lower bound of the bracket
x1 - the upper bound of the bracket
err - the stopping criteria, in percent, which the approximate error of the current guess must be below to stop the function and output the final answer.
###Outputs
zero - the zero of the function within the given bracket
